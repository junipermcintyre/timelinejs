# TimelineJS

This is a really straightforward JavaScript class for rendering a timeline block of HTML to a page.

It uses DOM manipulation to create the nodes, add classes, then insert them into the document.

Classes are mapped to the styles in `timeline.css`. It's meant to be edited.

## Installation

1. Source the JS class on your page somewhere
2. Add a div to your page
3. Just read `index.html` and `main.js` for an example honestly
4. Don't forget to source `timeline.css` or it won't look like much.

Cheers!
